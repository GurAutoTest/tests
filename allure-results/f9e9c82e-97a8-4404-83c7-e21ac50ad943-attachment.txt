--- Recurring Amount Calculation Steps ---
Plan Amount: 1200
Total Payments: 18
Interest Rate Used: 16.99
Logic: Total Payments >= 13 (Using Compound/Exponential Logic)
Step 1: Rate Factor (1 + 16.99/1200) = 1.0141583333333333
Step 2: Compound Factor (1.0141583333333333 ^ 18) = 1.287964061221489
Step 3: Plan Amount * Compound Factor (1200 * 1.287964061221489) = 1545.556873465787
Step 4: Total / Total Payments (1545.556873465787 / 18) = 81.34509860346247
